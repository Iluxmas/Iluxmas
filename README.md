## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Ilya and I am going to be Senior Frontend Developer in four years (haha, really :relieved:)

Things interesting to me:

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Efficiency and automatization
- :apple: Fine design with attention to UX 
- :question: Tasks not everyone can solve

My current focus is a deep dive into React and Redux. Joined Hexlet-Codebattle opensource project to contribute and gain new knowledge.
