## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Ilya and I am going to be Senior Frontend Developer in four years (haha, really :relieved:)

**Things interesting to me:**

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Efficiency and automatization <!--`(don't want my memory to leak)`-->
- :apple: Fine design with attention to UX <!--`(it is already a lot of with poor usability)`-->
- :question: Tasks not everyone can solve <!--`( )`-->

My current focus is a deep dive into React and Redux. Joined Hexlet-Codebattle opensource project to contribute and gain new knowledge.

**Tech stack:** `React.js` `Webpack` `Jest` `HTML` `BEM` `CSS` `SCSS`
